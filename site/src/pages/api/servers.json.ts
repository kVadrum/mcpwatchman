 * The machine surface, and a primary one rather than a courtesy.
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` is explicit that every surface must be fully readable by humans
 * AND by agents, neither treated as the real audience. This is the same data
 * the pages render, in the shape a program would want it.
 *
 * It carries no composite, for the same reason no page does: the weighted score
 * is computed and withheld until calibration. A consumer that wants one would
 * have to weight the axes itself, and would then own that choice — which is the
 * honest arrangement while ours is unvalidated.
